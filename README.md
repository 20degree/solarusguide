# solarusguide

Id like to create some free pdf guide about the software Solarus. As a step by step, with many details and explications; this guide should respond to mainly one principle question "How to do this/that?".

Example of "How to do this":
How to import some sprite? How to import some tiles? How to define some sprites? How to define some tiles? How to put some tiles at some level? And many many more. The best way is that you think when you first started playing with Solarus, and you wanted to know many things; that started with a simple question "How to do this/that?".

Thank's for your time to readme.
